hi im @lmof0, but i'd prefer it if you called me lmof<br>
i program occasionally and i figured this is a good way of sharing it<br>
im decent in python and js, and have lesser experience in rust, c#, java, and some others that i can't remember<br>

if i ever put stuff up here other than my silly website, then i'll probably end up being more github-active<br>
until then,,,
